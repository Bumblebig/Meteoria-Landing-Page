        <h2>About Meteoria Weather Forecast</h2>
        <p>It all began with a fascination for the ever-changing skies, the dance of raindrops on windowpanes, and the unpredictability of nature's moods. Meteoria was born out of a genuine passion for understanding and predicting weather conditions. It's not just a project because Holberton required it; it's a project fueled by a lifelong curiosity and love for meteorology.</p>
    <p>As a team of weather enthusiasts, we embarked on this journey to create a weather forecasting tool that's not only accurate but also easy to use. We wanted to provide a platform where anyone, anywhere, could access up-to-date weather information effortlessly.</p>
        <p>This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School.</p>
